MLP training Algorithm
Given a comma-seprated datafile, whose last column denotes the class, you have to train a neural network. First, the size of the input layer 
d is determined by the number of attributes (other than the class), and the size of the output layer 
p is determined by the number of classes. You should input the size of the hidden layer 
m from the command line. You goal is to train a three-layer neural network, with a single hidden layer,
